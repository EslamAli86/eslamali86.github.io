    description: "Using a narrative style is an effective way to communicate health information both on and off social media. Given the amount of misinformation being spread online and its potential negative effects, it is crucial to investigate the interplay between narrative communication style and misinformative health content on user engagement on social media platforms. To explore this in the context of Twitter, we start with previously annotated health misinformation tweets (n ≈15,000) and annotate a subset of the data (n=3,000) for the presence of narrative style. We then use these manually assigned labels to train text classifiers, experimenting with supervised fine-tuning and in-context learning for automatic narrative detection. We use our best model to label remaining portion of the dataset, then statistically analyze the relationship between narrative style, misinformation, and user-level features on engagement, finding that narrative use is connected to increased tweet engagement and can, in some cases, lead to increased engagement with misinformation. Finally, we analyze the general categories of language used in narratives and health misinformation in our dataset."

    abstract: "Search and recommendation systems are ubiquitous and irreplaceable tools in our daily lives. Despite their critical role in selecting and ranking the most relevant information, they typically do not consider the veracity of information presented to the user. In this paper, we introduce an audit methodology to investigate the extent of misinformation presented in search results and recommendations on online marketplaces. We investigate the factors and personalization attributes that influence the amount of misinformation in searches and recommendations. Recently, several media reports criticized Amazon for hosting and recommending items that promote misinformation on topics such as vaccines. Motivated by those reports, we apply our algorithmic auditing methodology on Amazon to verify those claims. Our audit study investigates (a) factors that might influence the search algorithms of Amazon and (b) personalization attributes that contribute to amplifying the amount of misinformation recommended to users in their search results and recommendations. Our audit study collected ~526k search results and ~182k homepage recommendations, with ~8.5k unique items. Each item is annotated for its stance on vaccines' misinformation (pro, neutral, or anti). Our study reveals that (1) the selection and ranking by the default Featured search algorithm of search results that have misinformation stances are positively correlated with the stance of search queries and customers' evaluation of items (ratings and reviews), (2) misinformation stances of search results are neither affected by users' activities nor by interacting (browsing, wish-listing, shopping) with items that have a misinformation stance, and (3) a filter bubble built-in users' homepages have a misinformation stance positively correlated with the misinformation stance of items that a user interacts with."
    description: "We audit Amazon to investigate whether personalization based on user history with the platform contributes to amplifying misinformation present in search results and recommendations. While user activities (searching, browsing, adding items to wishlist or shopping cart) do not have a significant effect, once a user interacts with items that have a misinformation stance toward vaccines (promoting, neutral, or opposing vaccines' misinformation), a filter bubble of misinformative recommendations is built in the user's homepage."

    abstract: "Search engines are the primary gateways of information. Yet, they do not take into account the credibility of search results. There is a growing concern that YouTube, the second largest search engine and the most popular video-sharing platform, has been promoting and recommending misinformative content for certain search topics. In this study, we audit YouTube to verify those claims. Our audit experiments investigate whether personalization (based on age, gender, geolocation, or watch history) contributes to amplifying misinformation. After shortlisting five popular topics known to contain misinformative content and compiling associated search queries representing them, we conduct two sets of audits —Search-and Watch-misinformative audits. Our audits resulted in a dataset of more than 56K videos compiled to link stance (whether promoting misinformation or not) with the personalization attribute audited. Our videos correspond to three major YouTube components: search results, Up-Next, and Top 5 recommendations. We find that demographics, such as, gender, age, and geolocation do not have a significant effect on amplifying misinformation in returned search results for users with brand new accounts. On the other hand, once a user develops a watch history, these attributes do affect the extent of misinformation recommended to them. Further analyses reveal a filter bubble effect, both in the Top 5 and Up-Next recommendations for all topics, except vaccine controversies; for these topics, watching videos that promote misinformation leads to more misinformative video recommendations.In conclusion, YouTube still has a long way to go to mitigate misinformation on its platform."

    description: In this work, we audit the YouTube recommendation system for recommending and spreading misinformation such as conspiracy theories, fake news, rumors, and falsified information. In our work, we experiment with YouTube from different angles and study its recommendation of misinformation from different perspectives (demographically/geographically).
