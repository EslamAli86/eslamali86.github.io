<p align="justify">Hi, my name is Eslam Hussein. I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. My research interests are in the broad areas of multimodal machine  learning, natural language processing, and social computing. I work under the supervision of Professor Chris Thomas on video entailment to detect out-of-context videos using multimodal machine learning and graph neural networks.</p>


### Experience
<p align="justify">Before I joined Virginia Tech, I worked as a research associate at <a href="https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/staff/eslam-ali-hassan-hussein">Qatar Computing Research Institute</a>, where I worked on graph analytics and search problems, and I published a demo paper at <a href="https://sigmod.org/sigmod-awards/sigmod-best-demonstration-award/">SIGMOD'17</a> (<b><i>honorable mention</i></b>). Before I joined QCRI, I worked as an assistant lecturer for eight years at Cairo University, where I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science. Working as an assistant lecturer contributed substantially to developing my teaching skills and broadening my knowledge in Computer Science. While working on my master's degree, I successfully published two conference papers and one journal paper. In parallel with my work at Cairo University, I also worked as a software engineer in multiple companies in Cairo, which helped in sharpening my software engineering skills and knowledge.</p>
