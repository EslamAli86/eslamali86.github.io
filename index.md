Hi, I am Eslam Hussein. I am a PhD student in the department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. My advisor is professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eldardiry/">Hoda Eldardiry</a>. My research interests are in the broad areas of social computing, natural language processing and machine learning.

Before I joined Virginia Tech, I worked as a research associate at <a href="https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/staff/eslam-ali-hassan-hussein">Qatar Compuing Reseach Institute</a>, where I worked on graph analytics and search problems and published a demo paper at <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3035918.3058742">SIGMOD'17</a> (<i>honorable mention</i>). Before I joined QCRI, I worked as an assistant lecturer for eight years at Cairo University where I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science. Working as an assistant lecturer contributed substantially in developing my teaching skills and broadening my knowledge in Computer Science. While working on may master's degree, I successfully published two conference papers and one journal paper. In parallel with my work at Cairo university, I also worked as a software engineer in multiple companies in Cairo, which helped in sharpening my software engineering skills and knowledge.
